# Components

## Layout

### Core layout guidance

- Use `eds-shell-template` for app-level chrome.
- Use `eds-application-layout` for resizable left/right work panels.
- Use `eds-panel-layout` for panel containers with optional header/footer.
- Use `eds-page-header` for page-level context and actions inside content.
- Keep landmark structure clear: nav in sidenav, app actions in appbar, content in main.

### Portal layout

### Application layout

- For application layout opened from app navigation, use `eds-shell-template` and omit the fixed `sidenav` slot.
- Implement `eds-appbar` in the `appbar` slot with `show-menu-button` and `is-application`.
- In the `icon` slot, use `sl-icon` with the Material icon set for the application glyph.
- In the `breadcrumb` slot, use `sl-breadcrumb` with a separator (`<span slot="separator">/</span>`) and `sl-breadcrumb-item` entries.
- In the `page-info` slot, use `eds-page-info` with `heading` set to the application page heading.
- In `eds-page-info`, place optional menu options in `heading-menu-items` using `sl-menu-item`.
- In `eds-page-info`, place optional state badges in the `badge` slot using `sl-badge`.
- In the `center` slot, use `sl-tab-group` for application-level tabs. Keep tab labels concise and noun-based.
- In the `right` slot, use concise utility actions such as `sl-button` and `sl-icon-button`.
- In the default content area (`main`), implement `eds-application-layout` as the primary layout container.
- For application pages, remove content-area padding and width constraints so the layout is full-bleed.
- Render `eds-application-layout` as a direct child of the application content area (avoid extra wrapper containers that can constrain sizing).
- Ensure `eds-application-layout` takes all available horizontal and vertical space (`inline-size: 100%`, `block-size: 100%`).
- Ensure slotted side panels also stretch vertically (`[slot='left-panel']` and `[slot='right-panel']` with `block-size: 100%`).
- Set `overflow-y: auto` on the left panel's scrollable content container so overflow content scrolls rather than wraps or overflows the panel boundary.
- Keep the right panel hidden by default and open it only from an explicit trigger in the main content area (for example, selecting a card or action item).
- Do not set `open-right` on initial `eds-application-layout` markup; add it only in response to an explicit user action.
- For all application pages, implement a modal `eds-sidenav` (use `mode="modal"`) and keep it hidden by default.
- Trigger the modal sidenav from the appbar menu button: provide a slotted menu button in `eds-appbar` (`slot="menu-button"`) and open the sidenav only on user click using `sidenav.show()`.
- Use the same navigation structure in the modal sidenav as the primary app sidenav (nodes, divider, section headings, and app items) to keep behavior consistent.
- On modal sidenav item click, navigate to the target route and then close the modal with `sidenav.hide()`.
- Support default modal dismissal behaviors (Esc key and outside click) and keep the sidenav focus-managed after opening.
- Prevent default-on-load visibility for modal sidenav (no automatic open during initialization; enforce hidden state before first user interaction).

### Page layout

- A page layout should include two clear regions: `page-header` and `page-content`.
- Use `eds-page-header` as the `page-header` region, and do not apply padding to it.
- Place all primary page body elements (cards, tables, forms, lists, charts) inside the `page-content` container.
- Do not place page body content directly beside the header without a `page-content` wrapper.
- Apply horizontal padding to `page-content` using `padding-inline: var(--sl-spacing-x-large)`.
- Apply vertical padding to `page-content` using `padding-block: var(--sl-spacing-large)`.
- Keep page-content spacing tokenized and scoped to the page container to avoid global side effects.
- When using `eds-application-layout` with a left side panel (`slot='left-panel'`), include a view-sidebar icon button in the page header: `<sl-icon-button slot="icon" library="material" name="view_sidebar" label="View sidebar"></sl-icon-button>`.
- The view-sidebar icon button should toggle `open-left` on `eds-application-layout`: remove the attribute when present to collapse the left panel, add it when absent to show the left panel.
- If tabs or a tree in `slot='left-panel'` drive main-region navigation, update the main-region content and the `eds-page-header` heading together from one active state.

### Card layout rules

- Use approved card components (`sl-card`, `eds-selectable-card`, `eds-catalog-card`) based on behavior.
- Use `var(--sl-spacing-large)` for both horizontal and vertical spacing between cards (for example, `column-gap` and `row-gap` in card grids).
- Cards in the same row must render at equal height.
- If the card `base` part is styleable, set `::part(base) { height: 100%; }`.
- If the card is wrapped or its `base` is not directly styleable, use `grid-auto-rows: 1fr` and item wrapper `height: 100%`, then apply `::part(base) { height: 100%; }` inside the component boundary when possible.
- Verify card heights in the browser on at least two rows before finalizing.
- Enforce card width at grid track level (for example with tokenized minmax tracks).
- Keep card sizing and spacing tokenized.

### Form layout baseline

- Prefer single-column form flow; expand to two columns only when space and readability support it.
- Keep typical `sl-input`, `sl-select`, and other form controls at `max-width: 30rem`; do not use unconstrained `width: 100%` on the controls unless the design explicitly requires full-width fields.
- Use two spacing levels: section-to-section `var(--sl-spacing-x-large)` and control-to-control `var(--sl-spacing-medium)`. Do not use `var(--sl-spacing-3x-small)` or `var(--sl-spacing-2x-small)` as the default form field gap.
- Use separate wrappers for section spacing vs field spacing: the section wrapper owns `var(--sl-spacing-x-large)`, and the field wrapper owns `var(--sl-spacing-medium)`.
- Before finalizing a form, verify both the rendered control width and the measured vertical gap between two adjacent fields against these rules.

## Radio group

- Use `sl-radio-group` with `sl-radio` children for mutually exclusive selections. Do not build custom radio controls from buttons or divs.
- Always set the `label` attribute on `sl-radio-group`. Do not omit it.
- Set a `value` attribute on each `sl-radio` to identify the selected option.

## Buttons

- Use `sl-button` for button actions unless an explicit requirement states otherwise.
- Default button size is `medium`.
- All buttons must remain content-fit to their labels; never stretch a button to full width unless explicitly required.
- Keep labels concise and action-oriented.
- In React, use the literal `class` attribute rather than `className` on Shoelace and EDS custom elements when a CSS class hook is required; verify the rendered custom element has the expected class before relying on that selector.
- Before finalizing a form, verify that every button is content-fit in the rendered layout and that any custom-element CSS hook is present on the element.

## Cards

- Use `eds-button-card` when the entire card triggers one action (for example open details, navigate, or start a flow) and does not represent a persistent selected state.
- Use `eds-selectable-card` when the card itself represents a selectable option or toggleable state.
- Set `heading` for the card title and use `control="checkbox"` or `control="switch"` based on the interaction pattern.
- Do not compose a selectable tile manually from `sl-card` plus a separate checkbox or switch unless a documented component limitation requires it.
- Use generic `sl-card` only for non-selectable, presentational containers.

## Panels

- Always use `eds-panel-layout` for panel content that must stay contained inside layout slots (for example, `slot='left-panel'` or `slot='right-panel'` in `eds-application-layout`).
- Do not place raw content directly in left/right slots; wrap slot content with `eds-panel-layout`.
- When using `eds-panel-layout` inside a slot container, remove extra container padding because `eds-panel-layout` already includes internal spacing.
- For `eds-panel-layout` with `closable`, close the parent slot panel on the `eds-close` event.
- Use `eds-panel` for fixed drawer overlay UI that should float over content rather than remain constrained by slot boundaries.
- Do not use `eds-panel` when the panel must remain visually contained inside the left or right slot region.
- For `eds-panel` overlays, manage visibility via its open state and close behavior via the `eds-hide` event.

## Dialogs

- Use `sl-dialog` for modal dialogs.
- Set a clear `label` attribute for the dialog title.
- Open dialogs with `show()` only on explicit user actions (for example, button click).
- Close dialogs with `hide()` from explicit footer actions or dismiss events (Esc key works by default).
- Always include a footer with two buttons in this order:
  1. `<sl-button>` with variant `default` for "Cancel"
  2. `<sl-button>` with variant `primary` for the confirmation action (for example, "Add", "Save", "Delete")
- Use a `<div slot="footer">` wrapper for footer actions with flex layout for right alignment.

## Tabs

- Use `sl-tab-group` with `sl-tab` only.
- Never use `sl-tab-panel` components.
- Keep tab labels short, scannable, and sentence case.
- For horizontal tabs, use default placement unless a requirement specifies otherwise.
- For vertical tabs, always use `placement="end"`.
- Vertical tabs should always fill the container width.
- Keep active-tab styling token-based; avoid hard-coded colors when EDS tokens exist.

## Sidenav

- Use `eds-sidenav` for app-level navigation inside `eds-shell-template` via `slot="sidenav"`.
- Do not add custom sidebar styling by default (no inline style/class hooks or sidenav-specific CSS overrides) unless a clear requirement exists.
- Set `header-text` and `logo` when app branding/context is required.
- Build navigation entries with `eds-sidenav-item` and use sentence case labels.
- Use `type="node"` for standard sidebar navigation items.
- To add a new sidebar section, place `<sl-divider></sl-divider>` after the previous group, then add `<eds-sidenav-item type="heading" label="Section name"></eds-sidenav-item>` before that section's items.
- Keep a single source of truth for nav items (for example, an array of `{ page, label, icon }`) and render items from it.
- For hash or client-side routing, keep the active item state synchronized with the current route.

## Tree

- Use `sl-tree` with `sl-tree-item` for hierarchical tree navigation. Do not build custom tree controls from buttons or divs.
- Set `selection="single"` on `sl-tree` for single-item selection; use `"multiple"` or `"leaf"` only when the interaction explicitly requires it.
- Add a `value` attribute to each `sl-tree-item` to identify the node on selection and query events.
- Nest `sl-tree-item` elements directly inside a parent `sl-tree-item` to create child levels; `sl-tree` manages expand/collapse controls automatically.
- Do not set `expanded` or `selected` as declarative React props — re-renders will overwrite the component's internal state. Set initial values imperatively after mount by querying `sl-tree-item[value="id"]` inside a `window.customElements.whenDefined('sl-tree-item').then(...)` callback.
- Listen to `sl-selection-change` on the `sl-tree` ref to update React state. Access the selected node via `e.detail.selection[0]` and read its `value` attribute.
- When the tree in `slot='left-panel'` drives main-region content, derive the `eds-page-header` heading from the same selected state.

## Expand and collapse

- Use `sl-details` for expandable and collapsible content sections.
- Do not build custom disclosure controls from standalone icons or buttons when the behavior is expand/collapse.
- Use the `summary` slot to render the section header content. Don't add custom headings.
- In the `content` slot, use `gap: var(--sl-spacing-medium);` for spacing between child elements.

## AVA

- Use `ava-layout` as the primary container for AVA chat-style experiences.
- Use `header-actions` slot for utility actions such as New chat (`sl-icon-button`, optionally wrapped with `sl-tooltip`).
- Use `ava-input` in the `footer` slot for message entry and controls.
- Use `ava-welcome-message` for onboarding content and starter actions.
- For welcome actions, use `eds-button-card` buttons in a token-spaced container and append them in `ava-welcome-message` footer slot.
- Use `ava-user-message` and `ava-response-message` for runtime chat messages.
- Message lifecycle should be imperative: append/remove AVA message elements with DOM APIs rather than static JSX lists.
- On send (`ava-send`), append user message first, set `ava-layout.waiting=true`, disable `ava-input`, then append response and restore input state.
- After message updates, call `ava-layout.scrollToBottom()` in `requestAnimationFrame` to keep the latest message in view.
- Keep AVA copy concise and action-oriented per `content.md`; avoid long, dense response text in starter templates.

## Toasts

- Always use `eds-toast` for toast notifications.
- Keep toast text short, specific, and action-result oriented (see `content.md`).
- Set message content with `text`.
- Use default lifetime (3000 ms) unless there is a clear product requirement to override it.
- Position the toast at bottom center by styling `::part(base)` with bottom offset `var(--sl-spacing-2x-large)`.
- Use a short ease-out entry transition with `transition` + `@starting-style` on `::part(base)`: animate `transform` and `opacity` together while preserving horizontal centering, starting at `translate(-50%, var(--sl-spacing-medium))` and `opacity: 0.5`, then ending at `translate(-50%, 0)` and `opacity: 1`.
- Do not use CSS `animation` on `::part(base)` because it can break the built-in fade-out.
- Keep toasts non-blocking (no focus trap and no required interaction).
- Imperative usage is required: create the element on trigger with `document.createElement('eds-toast')` and `appendChild`; never render toast as static markup.
